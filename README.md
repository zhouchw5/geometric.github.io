## A Skyscraper and An Innovative Geometrical Method      

This article is telling the past when I grabbed the indication from the shape of a skycraper and figured out an innovative way to solve 
a geometric problem in my second grade in high school. The key words in this article are Geometry, Skycraper, and Checkers.

This Sunday night I went for a movie named Skyscraper, with my sister who was in her significantly compressed summer vacation before her third year in high school. 
In the third year she would attend the college entrance examination. Despite that it has been more than five years since I finished the examination and got admitted to my university, 
I can still understand her physical and mental state in this special stage.

This movie has been shot in Hongkong, with a story developed in a fictitious skyscraper, which is located in Victorian Harbour.
Hands down Hongkong has the most beautiful skyline in the world, with many vast buildings accmmodated in such a tiny island.The breathtaking view in the movie still catched my eye though each year I spent much time in Hongkong. And my story with these buildings is further than appreciation of the beauty, but also my appreciation for one of those skycrapers that helped me solve a geometric problem in high school. I shared my story with my sister after the movie, to encourage her to keep passion in study.          


The interesting geometric problem was from the textbook of Mathematics Compulsory Edition II, shown as below:

## Question:      
      
      
In the equilateral triangle ▲ABC,       
![triange](https://github.com/zhouchw5/geometric.github.io/blob/master/figure.png)         

points D, E are located in the edge BC, AC respectively, satisfying      
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\mid&space;BD&space;\mid&space;=&space;1/3&space;\mid&space;BC\mid,&space;\&space;\&space;\mid&space;CE&space;\mid&space;=&space;1/3&space;\mid&space;CA&space;\mid$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\mid&space;BD&space;\mid&space;=&space;1/3&space;\mid&space;BC\mid,&space;\&space;\&space;\mid&space;CE&space;\mid&space;=&space;1/3&space;\mid&space;CA&space;\mid$" title="$\mid BD \mid = 1/3 \mid BC\mid, \ \ \mid CE \mid = 1/3 \mid CA \mid$" /></a>         
segment AD and BE intersect at P. We need to prove that:     
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$AP&space;\bot&space;CP$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$AP&space;\bot&space;CP$" title="$AP \bot CP$" /></a>            

- **I would share two of my methods to solve this simple problem, one of which is the conventional coordinate method, the other one is the gift endowed by the sense of vision.**     
                 
## Solution I:          
Firsty, we can construct the perpendicular line AO of the edge BC through point A, which would intersect BC at O. 
Then we can construct a Cartesian coordinate system, with line OC as the X axis and line OA as the y axis:    
![triangleandaxis](https://github.com/zhouchw5/geometric.github.io/blob/master/figure2.png)       


In the equilateral triangle ▲ABC, the coordinate of each vertex can be writen as 
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$B(-1,0),&space;C(1,0),&space;A(0,\sqrt{3}&space;)$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$B(-1,0),&space;C(1,0),&space;A(0,\sqrt{3}&space;)$" title="$B(-1,0), C(1,0), A(0,\sqrt{3} )$" /></a>       

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\because|CE|&space;=&space;1/3|CA|,&space;|BD|&space;=&space;1/3|BC|$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\because|CE|&space;=&space;1/3|CA|,&space;|BD|&space;=&space;1/3|BC|$" title="$\because|CE| = 1/3|CA|, |BD| = 1/3|BC|$" /></a>         
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\therefore&space;E(2/3,\sqrt{3}/3),&space;D(-1/3,0)$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\therefore&space;E(2/3,\sqrt{3}/3),&space;D(-1/3,0)$" title="$\therefore E(2/3,\sqrt{3}/3), D(-1/3,0)$" /></a>       
                
                
Then we need to formula the representations of the straight lines BE and AD, to compute the coordinate of point P.         
The basic forms of the two straight lines' equation can be shown as:      
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$AD:&space;(y-\sqrt{3})/x=y/(x&plus;1/3);\&space;\&space;\&space;BE:y/(x&plus;1)=(y-\sqrt{3}/3)/(x-2/3);$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$AD:&space;(y-\sqrt{3})/x=y/(x&plus;1/3);\&space;\&space;\&space;BE:y/(x&plus;1)=(y-\sqrt{3}/3)/(x-2/3);$" title="$AD: (y-\sqrt{3})/x=y/(x+1/3);\ \ \ BE:y/(x+1)=(y-\sqrt{3}/3)/(x-2/3);$" /></a>          
We can simplify the representations and solve the linear equations with two variables to figure out the coordinate of point P:         
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$y-3\sqrt{3}x-\sqrt{3}=0&space;\\&space;5y-\sqrt{3}x-\sqrt{3}=0&space;\\&space;x=-2/7,&space;\&space;y=\sqrt{3}/7$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$y-3\sqrt{3}x-\sqrt{3}=0&space;\\&space;5y-\sqrt{3}x-\sqrt{3}=0&space;\\&space;x=-2/7,&space;\&space;y=\sqrt{3}/7$" title="$y-3\sqrt{3}x-\sqrt{3}=0 \\ 5y-\sqrt{3}x-\sqrt{3}=0 \\ x=-2/7, \ y=\sqrt{3}/7$" /></a>       
            
            
Currently we know the coordinate of point P can be represented as:      
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$P(-2/7,&space;\&space;\sqrt{3}/7)$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$P(-2/7,&space;\&space;\sqrt{3}/7)$" title="$P(-2/7, \ \sqrt{3}/7)$" /></a>      

And then we can obtain two vectors:        
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$&space;PC&space;=&space;(9/7,&space;\&space;-\sqrt{3}/7)&space;\\&space;\vec{PA}&space;=&space;(2/7,&space;\&space;6\sqrt{3}/7)$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$&space;PC&space;=&space;(9/7,&space;\&space;-\sqrt{3}/7)&space;\\&space;\vec{PA}&space;=&space;(2/7,&space;\&space;6\sqrt{3}/7)$" title="$ PC = (9/7, \ -\sqrt{3}/7) \\ \vec{PA} = (2/7, \ 6\sqrt{3}/7)$" /></a>       
Obviously <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$PC&space;\cdot&space;\vec{PA}&space;=&space;0$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$PC&space;\cdot&space;\vec{PA}&space;=&space;0$" title="$PC \cdot \vec{PA} = 0$" /></a>            
And both PC and PA are nonzero vectors, so we can conclude that          
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$AP&space;\bot&space;CP$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$AP&space;\bot&space;CP$" title="$AP \bot CP$" /></a>           
            
- **The solution above is the conventional method related to these simple geometric problems, which an conscientious math teacher must have imparted to his/her students.But the story would not reach the end right here. The more interesting part would be shown as below.**            
              
## Solution II:            
Firstly we can utilise the trisection points in each edge of the equilateral triangle to divide it into eight small equilateral triangles as below:         
![Checkersmodel](https://github.com/zhouchw5/geometric.github.io/blob/master/Checkersmodel01.png)           
_It is convenient to extract different combinations of equilateral triangular elements from the this divided figure_             
         
I have also made an abbreviation for the divided figure as the Checkers Model shown as below, with the figurative similarity to the checkers.            
![checkers](https://github.com/zhouchw5/geometric.github.io/blob/master/checkers.jpg)              
           
This model is also related to the fascinating nightscape on Victorian Harbour and the skycraper shown as below which indicated me to make use of equilateral triangle elements. I believe that beauty always has a moral and life would not forgive a single day without imagination.               
![skyscrapers](https://github.com/zhouchw5/geometric.github.io/blob/master/skyscraper.jpg)             
           
           
           
           
           
          
- **The basic framework of this solution is to prove the similarity between ▲APJ and ▲CIJ, then we can conclude that AP is perpendicular to CP, which is similar to the relation that AI is perpendicular to IC.**             
            
            



We extract the isosceles trapezoid OFBD from the divided figure and show it in a more readable perspective:                
![trapezoid](https://github.com/zhouchw5/geometric.github.io/blob/master/extracted%20isosceles%20trapezoid.png)                      
_For the subsequent arrangement, in this isosceles trapezoid we need to prove the similarity between ▲OGD and ▲DHB. _
