## A Skyscraper and An Innovative geometrical method      

This article is telling the past when I grabbed the indication from the shape of a skycraper and figured out an innovative way to solve 
a geometric problem in my second grade in high school. The key words in this article are Geometry, Skycraper, and Checkers.

This Sunday night I went for a movie named Skyscraper, with my sister who was in her significantly compressed summer vacation before her third year in high school. 
In the third year she would attend the college entrance examination. Despite that it has been more than five years since I finished the examination and got admitted to my university, 
I can still understand her physical and mental state in this special stage.

This movie has been shot in Hongkong, with a story developed in a fictitious skyscraper, which is located in Victorian Harbour.
Hands down Hongkong has the most beautiful skyline in the world, with many vast buildings accmmodated in such a tiny island.The breathtaking
view in the movie still catched my eye though each year I spent much time in Hongkong. And my story with these buildings is further than 
appreciation of the beauty, but also my appreciation for one of those skycrapers that helped me solve a geometric problem in high school.
I shared my story with my sister after the movie, to encourage her to keep passion in study.   

The interesting geometric problem was from the textbook of Mathematics Compulsory Edition II, shown as below:

## Question:      
      
      
In the equilateral triangle ▲ABC,       
![figure][doge]           
points D, E are located in the edge BC, AC respectively, satisfying      
![formula1][dogc]
,segment AD and BE intersect at P. We need to prove that:     
![formula1][dogd]         
- **I would share two of my methods to solve this simple problem, one of which is the conventional coordinate method, the other one is the gift endowed by the sense of vision.**     
                 
## Solutions I:          
Firsty, we can construct the perpendicular line AO of the edge BC through point A, which would intersect BC at O. 
Then we can construct a Cartesian coordinate system, with line OC as the X axis and line OA as the y axis:    
![figure][dogf]       
In the equilateral triangle ▲ABC, the coordinate of each vertex can be writen as 
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$B(-1,0),&space;C(1,0),&space;A(0,\sqrt{3}&space;)$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$B(-1,0),&space;C(1,0),&space;A(0,\sqrt{3}&space;)$" title="$B(-1,0), C(1,0), A(0,\sqrt{3} )$" /></a>       
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\because|CE|&space;=&space;1/3|CA|,&space;|BD|&space;=&space;1/3|BC|$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\because|CE|&space;=&space;1/3|CA|,&space;|BD|&space;=&space;1/3|BC|$" title="$\because|CE| = 1/3|CA|, |BD| = 1/3|BC|$" /></a>         
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\therefore&space;E(2/3,\sqrt{3}/3),&space;D(-1/3,0)$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\therefore&space;E(2/3,\sqrt{3}/3),&space;D(-1/3,0)$" title="$\therefore E(2/3,\sqrt{3}/3), D(-1/3,0)$" /></a>       
Then we need to formula the representations of the straight lines BE and AD, to compute the coordinate of point P.         
The basic forms of the two straight lines' equation can be shown as:      
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$AD:&space;(y-\sqrt{3})/x=y/(x&plus;1/3);\&space;\&space;\&space;BE:y/(x&plus;1)=(y-\sqrt{3}/3)/(x-2/3);$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$AD:&space;(y-\sqrt{3})/x=y/(x&plus;1/3);\&space;\&space;\&space;BE:y/(x&plus;1)=(y-\sqrt{3}/3)/(x-2/3);$" title="$AD: (y-\sqrt{3})/x=y/(x+1/3);\ \ \ BE:y/(x+1)=(y-\sqrt{3}/3)/(x-2/3);$" /></a>          
We can simplify the representations and solve the linear equations with two variables to figure out the coordinate of point P:         
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$y-3\sqrt{3}x-\sqrt{3}=0&space;\\&space;5y-\sqrt{3}x-\sqrt{3}=0&space;\\&space;x=-2/7,&space;\&space;y=\sqrt{3}/7$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$y-3\sqrt{3}x-\sqrt{3}=0&space;\\&space;5y-\sqrt{3}x-\sqrt{3}=0&space;\\&space;x=-2/7,&space;\&space;y=\sqrt{3}/7$" title="$y-3\sqrt{3}x-\sqrt{3}=0 \\ 5y-\sqrt{3}x-\sqrt{3}=0 \\ x=-2/7, \ y=\sqrt{3}/7$" /></a>       
Currently we know the coordinate of point P can be represented as:      
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$P(-2/7,&space;\&space;\sqrt{3}/7)$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$P(-2/7,&space;\&space;\sqrt{3}/7)$" title="$P(-2/7, \ \sqrt{3}/7)$" /></a>         
And then we can obtain two vectors:        
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$&space;PC&space;=&space;(9/7,&space;\&space;-\sqrt{3}/7)&space;\\&space;\vec{PA}&space;=&space;(2/7,&space;\&space;6\sqrt{3}/7)$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$&space;PC&space;=&space;(9/7,&space;\&space;-\sqrt{3}/7)&space;\\&space;\vec{PA}&space;=&space;(2/7,&space;\&space;6\sqrt{3}/7)$" title="$ PC = (9/7, \ -\sqrt{3}/7) \\ \vec{PA} = (2/7, \ 6\sqrt{3}/7)$" /></a>       
Obviously <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$PC&space;\cdot&space;\vec{PA}&space;=&space;0$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$PC&space;\cdot&space;\vec{PA}&space;=&space;0$" title="$PC \cdot \vec{PA} = 0$" /></a>            
And both PC and PA are nonzero vectors, so we can conclude that          
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$AP&space;\bot&space;CP$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$AP&space;\bot&space;CP$" title="$AP \bot CP$" /></a>
