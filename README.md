## A Skyscraper and An Innovative Geometrical Method      

This article is telling the past when I grabbed the indication from the shape of a skycraper and figured out an innovative way to solve 
a geometric problem in my second grade in high school. The key words in this article are Geometry, Skycraper, and Checkers.

This Sunday night I went for a movie named Skyscraper, with my sister who was in her significantly compressed summer vacation before her third year in high school. 
In the third year she would attend the college entrance examination. Despite that it has been more than five years since I finished the examination and got admitted to my university, 
I can still understand her physical and mental state in this special stage.

This movie has been shot in Hongkong, with a story developed in a fictitious skyscraper, which is located in Victorian Harbour.
Hands down Hongkong has the most beautiful skyline in the world, with many vast buildings accmmodated in such a tiny island.The breathtaking view in the movie still catched my eye though each year I spent much time in Hongkong. And my story with these buildings is further than appreciation of the beauty, but also my appreciation for one of those skycrapers that helped me solve a geometric problem in high school. I shared my story with my sister after the movie, to encourage her to keep passion in study.          


The interesting geometric problem was from the textbook of Mathematics Compulsory Edition II, shown as below:

## Question:      
      
      
In the equilateral triangle ▲ABC,       
![triange](https://github.com/zhouchw5/geometric.github.io/blob/master/figure.png)         

points D, E are located in the edge BC, AC respectively, satisfying      
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\mid&space;BD&space;\mid&space;=&space;1/3&space;\mid&space;BC\mid,&space;\&space;\&space;\mid&space;CE&space;\mid&space;=&space;1/3&space;\mid&space;CA&space;\mid$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\mid&space;BD&space;\mid&space;=&space;1/3&space;\mid&space;BC\mid,&space;\&space;\&space;\mid&space;CE&space;\mid&space;=&space;1/3&space;\mid&space;CA&space;\mid$" title="$\mid BD \mid = 1/3 \mid BC\mid, \ \ \mid CE \mid = 1/3 \mid CA \mid$" /></a>         
segment AD and BE intersect at P. We need to prove that:     
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$AP&space;\bot&space;CP$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$AP&space;\bot&space;CP$" title="$AP \bot CP$" /></a>            

- **I would share two of my methods to solve this simple problem, one of which is the conventional coordinate method, the other one is the gift endowed by the sense of vision.**     
                 
## Solution I:          
Firsty, we can construct the perpendicular line AO of the edge BC through point A, which would intersect BC at O. 
Then we can construct a Cartesian coordinate system, with line OC as the X axis and line OA as the y axis:    
![triangleandaxis](https://github.com/zhouchw5/geometric.github.io/blob/master/figure2.png)       


In the equilateral triangle ▲ABC, the coordinate of each vertex can be writen as 
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$B(-1,0),&space;C(1,0),&space;A(0,\sqrt{3}&space;)$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$B(-1,0),&space;C(1,0),&space;A(0,\sqrt{3}&space;)$" title="$B(-1,0), C(1,0), A(0,\sqrt{3} )$" /></a>       

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\because|CE|&space;=&space;1/3|CA|,&space;|BD|&space;=&space;1/3|BC|$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\because|CE|&space;=&space;1/3|CA|,&space;|BD|&space;=&space;1/3|BC|$" title="$\because|CE| = 1/3|CA|, |BD| = 1/3|BC|$" /></a>         
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\therefore&space;E(2/3,\sqrt{3}/3),&space;D(-1/3,0)$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\therefore&space;E(2/3,\sqrt{3}/3),&space;D(-1/3,0)$" title="$\therefore E(2/3,\sqrt{3}/3), D(-1/3,0)$" /></a>       
                
                
Then we need to formula the representations of the straight lines BE and AD, to compute the coordinate of point P.         
The basic forms of the two straight lines' equation can be shown as:      
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$AD:&space;(y-\sqrt{3})/x=y/(x&plus;1/3);\&space;\&space;\&space;BE:y/(x&plus;1)=(y-\sqrt{3}/3)/(x-2/3);$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$AD:&space;(y-\sqrt{3})/x=y/(x&plus;1/3);\&space;\&space;\&space;BE:y/(x&plus;1)=(y-\sqrt{3}/3)/(x-2/3);$" title="$AD: (y-\sqrt{3})/x=y/(x+1/3);\ \ \ BE:y/(x+1)=(y-\sqrt{3}/3)/(x-2/3);$" /></a>          
We can simplify the representations and solve the linear equations with two variables to figure out the coordinate of point P:         
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$y-3\sqrt{3}x-\sqrt{3}=0&space;\\&space;5y-\sqrt{3}x-\sqrt{3}=0&space;\\&space;x=-2/7,&space;\&space;y=\sqrt{3}/7$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$y-3\sqrt{3}x-\sqrt{3}=0&space;\\&space;5y-\sqrt{3}x-\sqrt{3}=0&space;\\&space;x=-2/7,&space;\&space;y=\sqrt{3}/7$" title="$y-3\sqrt{3}x-\sqrt{3}=0 \\ 5y-\sqrt{3}x-\sqrt{3}=0 \\ x=-2/7, \ y=\sqrt{3}/7$" /></a>       
            
            
Currently we know the coordinate of point P can be represented as:      
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$P(-2/7,&space;\&space;\sqrt{3}/7)$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$P(-2/7,&space;\&space;\sqrt{3}/7)$" title="$P(-2/7, \ \sqrt{3}/7)$" /></a>      

And then we can obtain two vectors:        
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$&space;PC&space;=&space;(9/7,&space;\&space;-\sqrt{3}/7)&space;\\&space;\vec{PA}&space;=&space;(2/7,&space;\&space;6\sqrt{3}/7)$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$&space;PC&space;=&space;(9/7,&space;\&space;-\sqrt{3}/7)&space;\\&space;\vec{PA}&space;=&space;(2/7,&space;\&space;6\sqrt{3}/7)$" title="$ PC = (9/7, \ -\sqrt{3}/7) \\ \vec{PA} = (2/7, \ 6\sqrt{3}/7)$" /></a>       
Obviously <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$PC&space;\cdot&space;\vec{PA}&space;=&space;0$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$PC&space;\cdot&space;\vec{PA}&space;=&space;0$" title="$PC \cdot \vec{PA} = 0$" /></a>            
And both PC and PA are nonzero vectors, so we can conclude that          
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$AP&space;\bot&space;CP$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$AP&space;\bot&space;CP$" title="$AP \bot CP$" /></a>           
            
- **The solution above is the conventional method related to these simple geometric problems, which an conscientious math teacher must have imparted to his/her students.But the story would not reach the end right here. The more interesting part would be shown as below.**            
              
## Solution II:            
Firstly we can utilise the trisection points in each edge of the equilateral triangle to divide it into eight small equilateral triangles as below:         
![Checkersmodel](https://github.com/zhouchw5/geometric.github.io/blob/master/Checkersmodel01.png)           
_It is convenient to extract different combinations of equilateral triangular elements from the this divided figure_             
         
I have also made an abbreviation for the divided figure as the Checkers Model shown as below, with the figurative similarity to the checkers.            
![checkers](https://github.com/zhouchw5/geometric.github.io/blob/master/checkers.jpg)              
           
This model is also related to the fascinating nightscape on Victorian Harbour and the skycraper shown as below which indicated me to make use of equilateral triangle elements. I believe that beauty always has a moral and life would not forgive a single day without imagination.               
![skyscrapers](https://github.com/zhouchw5/geometric.github.io/blob/master/skyscraper.jpg)             
           
           
           
           
           
          
- **The basic framework of this solution is to prove the similarity between ▲APJ and ▲CIJ, then we can conclude that AP is perpendicular to CP, which is similar to the relation that AI is perpendicular to IC.**             
            
            



We extract the isosceles trapezoid OFBD from the divided figure and show it in a more readable perspective:                
![trapezoid](https://github.com/zhouchw5/geometric.github.io/blob/master/extracted%20isosceles%20trapezoid.png)                      
_For the subsequent arrangement, in this isosceles trapezoid we need to prove the similarity between ▲OGD and ▲DHB. Based on the congruence among all equilateral triangle elements, obviously |OF|=|OD|=|DB|, ∠FOD = ∠ODB = 120°. Thus the rest orientation of the story is to prove |GO| = |HD|, which means that point G and H should be the midpoints of OF and OD, respectively._            
          
Before exploring the isosceles trapezoid OFBD to grab what we need, we would discuss the extractions related to proving that point G and H are the midpoints of OF and OD:                 
![twoextractedtriangles](https://github.com/zhouchw5/geometric.github.io/blob/master/extraction01.png)          
_Both (a) and (b) are partly extractions from the divided figure. Obviously figure (a) is congruent to figure (b), with a 120° clockwise rotation._          
          
Based on the combination of equilateral triangle elements, we know that in figure (a), |BD|=|DK|=|KE|, and DO // EK, for which ▲BDH is similar to ▲BKE and the similarity coefficient is k=1/2. Thus, |DH|=1/2|KE|=1/2|DO|, H should be the midpoint of DO. Similarly, we can conclude that G is the midpoint of FO. Then we can go back to the isosceles trapezoid ODBF and conclude that |GO| = |HD|, thus we can obtain in the isosceles trapezoid finally:            
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\bigtriangleup&space;OGD&space;\cong&space;\Delta&space;DHB$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\bigtriangleup&space;OGD&space;\cong&space;\Delta&space;DHB$" title="$\bigtriangleup OGD \cong \Delta DHB$" /></a>           
             
             
This congruence relation would grow a new conclusion that ∠CBE = ∠ADO in the divided figure. These two angles are located in ▲PBC and ▲ODA respectively. The relation between these two angles would help us figure out something valuable between the two triangles, which contain ∠JCIand ∠JAP respectively. Thus along this line we can reach a figure revealing the relation between ▲JCI and ▲JAP, the numerical relation between ∠JIC and ∠JPA.         
Currently we should go back to the divided figure and extract ▲PBC and ▲ODA:             
![similarextraction](https://github.com/zhouchw5/geometric.github.io/blob/master/twosimilartriangles.png)             
                
Then we collect our maps into one diagram shown as below:         
![finalmap](https://github.com/zhouchw5/geometric.github.io/blob/master/finalmap.png)            
_Based on the relation ∠CBP = ∠ADO that we obtain from the congruence between ▲OGD and ▲DHB, we just need to compute the numerical relation of |BP| VS |OD|, and |BC| VS |AD|, only with which we can gain enough clues to figure out the relation between ▲PBC and ▲ODA._           
         
Thus in the figure (c), we define |OD|=1.           
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\because$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\because$" title="$\because$" /></a>
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\triangle&space;OGD&space;\simeq&space;\bigtriangleup&space;DHB$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\triangle&space;OGD&space;\simeq&space;\bigtriangleup&space;DHB$" title="$\triangle OGD \simeq \bigtriangleup DHB$" /></a>                   
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\therefore$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\therefore$" title="$\therefore$" /></a>
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\angle&space;HBD&space;=&space;\angle&space;ODG$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\angle&space;HBD&space;=&space;\angle&space;ODG$" title="$\angle HBD = \angle ODG$" /></a>          
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\because$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\because$" title="$\because$" /></a>
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\angle&space;HBD&space;=&space;\angle&space;ODG,&space;\angle&space;DHB&space;=&space;\angle&space;DHB$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\angle&space;HBD&space;=&space;\angle&space;ODG,&space;\angle&space;DHB&space;=&space;\angle&space;DHB$" title="$\angle HBD = \angle ODG, \angle DHB = \angle DHB$" /></a>             
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\therefore&space;\triangle&space;HDK&space;\simeq&space;\triangle&space;HBD$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\therefore&space;\triangle&space;HDK&space;\simeq&space;\triangle&space;HBD$" title="$\therefore \triangle HDK \simeq \triangle HBD$" /></a>              
And based on our definition, |HD| = 1/2|OD| = 1/2, |DB| = |OD| = 1. We know that the isosceles trapezoid in the figure (c) is related to the combination of equilateral triangle elements in the divied figure (a), therefore obviously ∠ODB=120°. And then we can utilize the length of DB and HD with the angle ∠ODB to compute the length of HB. Futhermore, with the similarity between ▲DHK and ▲BHD, we can subsequently compute the length of HK in order to figure out |KB| with equivalence to |PB| in figure (a). Finally, with the situation of |PB|, we can go back to the extraction of ▲PBC and ▲ODA to dig out the only one missing piece from our puzzle.                
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$cos120^\circ&space;=&space;(\mid&space;HD&space;\mid&space;^{2}&plus;&space;\mid&space;DB&space;\mid^{2}-\mid&space;HB&space;\mid^{2})/(2\mid&space;DH&space;\mid&space;\cdot&space;\mid&space;DB&space;\mid)$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$cos120^\circ&space;=&space;(\mid&space;HD&space;\mid&space;^{2}&plus;&space;\mid&space;DB&space;\mid^{2}-\mid&space;HB&space;\mid^{2})/(2\mid&space;DH&space;\mid&space;\cdot&space;\mid&space;DB&space;\mid)$" title="$cos120^\circ = (\mid HD \mid ^{2}+ \mid DB \mid^{2}-\mid HB \mid^{2})/(2\mid DH \mid \cdot \mid DB \mid)$" /></a>              
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\mid&space;HB&space;\mid&space;=&space;\sqrt{\mid&space;HD&space;\mid^{2}&plus;\mid&space;DB&space;\mid^{2}-2cos120^\circ\cdot\mid&space;DH&space;\mid\cdot&space;\mid&space;DB&space;\mid}&space;=&space;\sqrt{7}/2$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\mid&space;HB&space;\mid&space;=&space;\sqrt{\mid&space;HD&space;\mid^{2}&plus;\mid&space;DB&space;\mid^{2}-2cos120^\circ\cdot\mid&space;DH&space;\mid\cdot&space;\mid&space;DB&space;\mid}&space;=&space;\sqrt{7}/2$" title="$\mid HB \mid = \sqrt{\mid HD \mid^{2}+\mid DB \mid^{2}-2cos120^\circ\cdot\mid DH \mid\cdot \mid DB \mid} = \sqrt{7}/2$" /></a>                
And then based on the similarity
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\triangle&space;HDK&space;\simeq&space;\triangle&space;HBD$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\triangle&space;HDK&space;\simeq&space;\triangle&space;HBD$" title="$\triangle HDK \simeq \triangle HBD$" /></a>,            
we know that
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\mid&space;HD&space;\mid&space;/&space;\mid&space;HB&space;\mid&space;=&space;\mid&space;HK&space;\mid&space;/&space;\mid&space;HD&space;\mid$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\mid&space;HD&space;\mid&space;/&space;\mid&space;HB&space;\mid&space;=&space;\mid&space;HK&space;\mid&space;/&space;\mid&space;HD&space;\mid$" title="$\mid HD \mid / \mid HB \mid = \mid HK \mid / \mid HD \mid$" /></a>              
so that we can obtain
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\mid&space;HK&space;\mid&space;=&space;\mid&space;HD&space;\mid^{2}/&space;\mid&space;HB&space;\mid&space;=&space;\sqrt{7}/14$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\mid&space;HK&space;\mid&space;=&space;\mid&space;HD&space;\mid^{2}/&space;\mid&space;HB&space;\mid&space;=&space;\sqrt{7}/14$" title="$\mid HK \mid = \mid HD \mid^{2}/ \mid HB \mid = \sqrt{7}/14$" /></a>
and
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\mid&space;KB&space;\mid&space;=&space;\mid&space;HB&space;\mid&space;-&space;\mid&space;HK&space;\mid&space;=&space;3\sqrt{7}/7$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\mid&space;KB&space;\mid&space;=&space;\mid&space;HB&space;\mid&space;-&space;tanke\mid&space;HK&space;\mid&space;=&space;3\sqrt{7}/7$" title="$\mid KB \mid = \mid HB \mid - \mid HK \mid = 3\sqrt{7}/7$" /></a>          
Then we move the extracted figure (c) back to the equilateral triangle in figure (a), we can obtain that
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\mid&space;PB&space;\mid&space;=&space;\mid&space;KB&space;\mid&space;=&space;3\sqrt{7}/7$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\mid&space;PB&space;\mid&space;=&space;\mid&space;KB&space;\mid&space;=&space;3\sqrt{7}/7$" title="$\mid PB \mid = \mid KB \mid = 3\sqrt{7}/7$" /></a>                    
Thus in terms of the triangle in figure (b), we have known the length |PB|, |BC|, and ∠PBC=∠ODA, which means that we have obtained enough characteristics to describe the triangle ▲PBC. Currently the last mystery in figure (b) of the integrated map is the triangle ▲ODA.            
              
Based on the Pythagorean theorem, we can obtain that               
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\mid&space;AD&space;\mid&space;=&space;\sqrt{\mid&space;AI&space;\mid^{2}&plus;\mid&space;DI&space;\mid^{2}}=\sqrt{(3\sqrt{3}/2)^{2}&plus;(1/2)^{2}}=\sqrt{7}$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\mid&space;AD&space;\mid&space;=&space;\sqrt{\mid&space;AI&space;\mid^{2}&plus;\mid&space;DI&space;\mid^{2}}=\sqrt{(3\sqrt{3}/2)^{2}&plus;(1/2)^{2}}=\sqrt{7}$" title="$\mid AD \mid = \sqrt{\mid AI \mid^{2}+\mid DI \mid^{2}}=\sqrt{(3\sqrt{3}/2)^{2}+(1/2)^{2}}=\sqrt{7}$" /></a>
